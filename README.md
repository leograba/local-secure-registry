# Local Registry With HTTPS #

This repository contains a local registry with a locally generated SSL
certificate, so I can use it with other technologies such as TorizonCore,
TorizonCore Builder and Torizon OTA without having to worry (too much) about
any potential side-effects of using an insecure registry.
